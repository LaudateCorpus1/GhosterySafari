The Ghostery Lite app extension for the Safari desktop browser works alongside Appleâ€™s new privacy ecosystem to bring Safari users comprehensive privacy protection. Check page performance, pause Ghostery Lite, trust a site and switch to your custom settings with a single click.

This project consists of three main components:

+ GhosteryLite: Native macOS container application that manages user settings and controls the Safari extensions
+ SafariExtension: UI Toolbar extension in Safari
+ ContentBlocker:  Content blocking extension in Safari

## Internationalization
We use Transifex and their CLI to manage our translation files. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client) to get started.

Note: There is no need to run `tx config` as the project has already been configured to work with Transifex. See the configuration file in `.tx/config`.

Next, [generate an API Token](https://www.transifex.com/user/settings/api/), run `tx init`, and paste the generated API Token when prompted.  This will allow the computer to push (Submit) and pull (Download) files to/from Transifex.

```sh
# Submit translation files to Transifex
$ tx push -s
```

```sh
# Download translated files from Transifex
$ tx pull -a
```
